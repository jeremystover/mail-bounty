<h3>About XRP Mail Bounty</h3>

<h3 class="panel-title"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Why? And how does it work?</h3>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>Email has made it so easy and inexpensive to send a message that as recipients, most of us are overwhelmed.  Unfortunately, email has no way to prioritize or sort the incoming requests for responses. Inbox management tools help, but they put the burden on the recipient to implement and maintain.  </p>
	
<p>What if your email was sorted for you based on the value of your response? The XRP Mail Bounty asks the sender to assign a value in XRP in the form of a bounty.  If you respond to the email before the bounty expires, you earn the XRP.  You can withdraw it to your wallet or use it to place bounties on the emails you send.  <b>You do not need to register for an account or install anything in order to receive and claim bounties - all you need is Gmail and an XRP Ledger account.</b></p>
<p>All the transactions (bounties), deposits and withdrawals are stored in a database.  You can check your account balance and XRP can be securely withdrawn or deposited at any time at http://mail-bounty.com.</p>
<p>Currently XRP Mail Bounty only works on Gmail.</p>
